# ArtificialEraCreator

## Description

A generative NFT art platform utilizing a hybrid AI architecture that combines transformers for style transfer and GANs for image synthesis, with on-chain provenance and decentralized storage via IPFS.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtificialEraCreator software project:
- "Generates synthetic datasets with realistic temporal and spatial correlations using Gaussian process models",
- "Trains neural networks with adaptive learning rates and momentum scheduling for accelerated convergence",
- "Supports multimodal input data fusion through Bayesian inference and uncertainty quantification",
- "Provides realtime anomaly detection and novelty scoring using oneclass SVM and local outlier factor algorithms",
- "Implements explainable AI techniques, including saliency mapping and feature importance analysis",
- "Offers automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization and grid search",
- "Includes data visualization tools with interactive 2D and 3D plotting for exploratory data analysis"
- Let me know if you need any adjustments!
